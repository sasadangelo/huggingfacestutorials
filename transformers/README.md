# Transformes Pipelines

This tutorials refer to the following [course page](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt). Reading this tutorial
you can learn what are Transformers and what can they do. Transformer models are used to solve all kinds of NLP tasks, like the ones 
mentioned in the previous section. The most basic object in the Transformers library is the pipeline() function. It connects a model 
with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer.
